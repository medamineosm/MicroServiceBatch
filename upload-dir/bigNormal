In both clinical and theoretical work in psychoanalysis, developments have taken place that frequently are not noted by persons who assume that all that can be said has been said by Freud.</P> <P>The study of religious phenomena, persons, events and traditions has always been a substantial part of applied psychoanalysis and here also major developments have taken place. It is no exaggeration to state that the scientific study of religion has been revolutionized by the integration of psychological perspectives, including the field of psychoanalysis.</P> <P>This volume differs from other recent publications on the topic of psychoanalysis and religion in drawing upon the entire field of psychoanalytic involvement with religion.

In this light, <EM>Psychodynamic Perspectives on Aging and Illness</EM> presents a fresh, contemporary application of psychodynamic theory, addressing the complex issues surrounding declining health. Informed by the spectrum of psychodynamic thought from self, relational, and classical theories, this forward looking volume offers more modern interpretations of theory, and techniques for working with a growing, complicated, but surprisingly resilient population. It illuminates how to enhance the therapeutic relationship in key areas such as addressing body- and self-image issues, approach sensitive topics, and understand the disconnect that can occur between medical patients and the often impersonal, technology-driven health care system. At the same time, the author cogently argues for pluralism in a therapeutic approach that is frequently threatened by forces both within and outside the field.

Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the outcome for most cancer patients is still dismal. Some stumbling blocks to developing effective therapy include the heterogeneity of cancer tissues, the lack of knowledge about the critical molecular mechanisms in cancer tissues (which are typically aberrant compared with mechanisms in normal tissue), and the lack of good mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. The recent findings that most cancers contain a small fraction of self-renewing, differentiation-blocked stem cell-like cells (cancer stem cells) and that it is these cells—and not the major bulk of the tissue—that are the root cause for cancer initiation and metastasis have also highlighted the need to change our approach to cancer therapy.</P> <P>The objectives of this book, therefore, would be to impart up-to-date information about the role of stem cells in the development of normal and cancerous tissue, the mechanisms that differentiate normal from cancerous functions, and the use of these findings in developing mechanism-based therapies.</P>;Will provide timely, cutting-edge information about cancer stem cells from the perspectives of both the basic and clinical sciences;9<HTLDTH=ijgbag>;Science

In order for many industries to survive and succeed, they need to develop highly effective coordination between supply chain partners, dynamic collaborative and strategic alliance relationships, and efficient logistics and supply chain network designs. Consequently, in the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest among academic researchers and industrial practitioners in innovative supply chain and logistics models, algorithms, and coordination policies. Mathematically distinct from classical supply chain management, this emerging research area has been proven to be useful and applicable to a wide variety of industries.

EPR spectroscopy has an important role in not only the geometric structural characterization of the redox cofactors in metalloproteins but also their electronic structure, as this is crucial for their reactivity. The advent of x-ray crystallographic snapshots of the active site redox cofactors in metalloenzymes in conjunction with high-resolution EPR spectroscopy has provided detailed structural insights into their catalytic mechanisms.</P> <P>This volume was conceived in 2005 at the Rocky Mountain Conference on Analytical Chemistry (EPR Symposium) to highlight the importance of high-resolution EPR spectroscopy to the structural (geometric and electronic) characterization of redox active cofactors in metalloproteins. We have been fortunate to have enlisted internationally recognized experts in this joint venture to provide the scientific community with an overview of high-resolution EPR and its application to metals in biology. This volume, High-Resolution EPR: Applications to Metalloenzymes and Metals in Medicine, covers high-resolution EPR methods, iron proteins, nickel and copper enzymes, and metals in medicine. An eloquent synopsis of each chapter is provided by John Pilbrow in the Introduction. A CD containing pdf files of all the chapters in this volume, some of which contain color figures, can be found attached to the inside back cover. A second volume, Metals in Biology: Applications of High-Resolution EPR to Metalloenzymes, will appear later this year covering the complement of other metalloproteins.</P> <P>One of the pioneers in the development of pulsed EPR and its application to metalloproteins was Arthur Schweiger, whose contribution we include in this volume. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly during the preparation of this volume. The editors and coauthors are extremely honored to dedicate this volume to the memory of Arthur Schweiger in recognition of his technical advances and insights into pulsed EPR and its application to metalloproteins. Arthur was extremely humble and treated everyone with equal respect. He was a gifted educator with an ability to explain complex phenomena in terms of simple intuitive pictures, had a delightful personality, and continues to be sadly missed by the community.</P> <P>It is an honor for the editors to facilitate the dissemination of these excellent contributions to the scientific community.

Prehistorians generally have only artifacts to study and rely on the diverse material record for their understanding of past societies and their behavior. Those involved in studying historically documented cultures not only have extensive material remains but also contemporary texts, images, and a range of investigative technologies to enable them to build a broader and more reflexive picture of how past societies, communities, and individuals operated and behaved. Increasingly, historical archaeology refers not to a particular period, place, or a method, but rather an approach that interrogates the tensions between artifacts and texts irrespective of context. In short, historical archaeology provides direct evidence for how humans have shaped the world we live in today.</P> <P>Historical archaeology is a branch of global archaeology that has grown in the last 40 years from its North American base into an increasingly global community of archaeologists each studying their area of the world in a historical context. Where historical archaeology started as part of the study of the post-Columbian societies of the United States and Canada, it has now expanded to interface with the post-medieval archaeologies of Europe and the diverse post-imperial experiences of Africa, Latin America, and Australasia.</P> <P>The 36 essays in the International Handbook of Historical Archaeology have been specially commissioned from the leading researchers in their fields, creating a wide-ranging digest of the increasingly global field of historical archaeology. The volume is divided into two sections, the first reviewing the key themes, issues, and approaches of historical archaeology today, and the second containing a series of case studies charting the development and current state of historical archaeological practice around the world.

Constituting an important dimension of daily life and of professional activities, argumentation plays a special role in democracies and is at the heart of philosophical reasoning and scientific inquiry. Argumentation, as such, requires specific intellectual and social skills. Hence, argumentation will have an increasing importance in education, both because it is a critical competence that has to be learned, and because argumentation can be used to foster learning in philosophy, history, sciences and in many other domains.</P> <P><EM>Argumentation and Education</EM> answers these and other questions by providing both theoretical backgrounds, in psychology, education and theory of argumentation, and concrete examples of experiments and results in school contexts in a range of domains.

Such illness can have serious consequences -- job loss, lawsuits, workplace violence—yet the effects of mental health issues on job functioning are rarely covered in clinical training. In addition, clinicians are often asked to provide opinions on an employee’s fitness for work or an evaluation for disability benefits, only to find themselves embroiled in complex legal and administrative conflicts. A unique collaboration between a renowned clinical professor of psychiatry and a noted legal expert, <EM>Evaluating Mental Health Disability in the Workplace</EM> approaches the topic from two distinct areas: the legal context and issues relevant to disability and disability-related evaluations, and the interplay of factors in the relationship between work and psychiatric illness.

They also provide a comprehensive road map for the practical use of CPN by showcasing selected industrial case studies that illustrate the practical use of CPN modelling and validation for design, specification, simulation, verification and implementation in various application domains.</P> <P>Their presentation primarily aims at readers interested in the practical use of CPN. Thus all concepts and constructs are first informally introduced through examples and then followed by formal definitions (which may be skipped). The book is ideally suitable for a one-semester course at an advanced undergraduate or graduate level, and through its strong application examples can also serve for self-study. An accompanying website offers additional material such as slides, exercises and project proposals.</P> <P>Book website: http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/</P>;;9<HTOGPC=aacida>;Students

It is now widely acknowledged that the therapeutic differentiation of stem cells into pancreatic cells is an ambitious endeavor that will not succeed without a thorough understanding of the molecular processes underlying the native development of the organ. This book, aimed at experts and students alike, offers a comprehensive review of the state of the art in both pancreatic development and regeneration.

Mitigating Environmental Problems in Exurban Development:An Overview of Rural-specific Planning Devices </P> <P> </P>;<P>Much of the country’s recent population growth is situated beyond the metropolitan fringe, where development consumes millions of acres of privately owned land. Exurbanization has become the dominant pattern of land development in America and there is no indication it will slow in the future. This development depletes agricultural and wildlands, and causes numerous environmental impacts ranging from the loss of biodiversity and wildland habitats to soil erosion, an increase in nonnative species, and the heightened threat to endangered species. Written for regional planners, planning commissions, local elected officials, environmental groups, and the public-at-large, The Planner’s Guide to Natural Resource Conservation provides readers from diverse, nonscientific backgrounds with a working knowledge of how and why exurbanization impacts environmental systems. Contributors include experts in rangeland ecology, restoration ecology, zoology, urban and regional planning, and conservation biology, who highlight the best practices to mitigate environmental problems or to avoid them altogether. Each chapter will leave readers with a firm grasp of relevant concepts and processes, an understanding of current research, and the know-how to apply science to land-use decisions.</P>;<P>First, we believe that environmental conservation is promoted best by opening the door to science, especially to those most directly involved with land development decisions: planners, city and county planning commissions and boards, local elected officials, land trusts, environmental groups and the public-at-large. We include the public in this group because they are directly affected by exurban land development and play a critical role in land-use decisions by voicing concerns at public hearings and meetings</P> <P>Second, we seek to broaden the involvement of environmental scientists in land-use planning. That is, environmental scientists can, and should, comment on land-use decisions at the outset instead of providing expert testimony later in the process, or evaluating the impacts of exurbanization after the fact. There is a growing movement among environmental scientists for more active participation in the land policy arena: the book provides such a venue</P>;9<HTLDTH=jibggg>;Science

The investigation takes as its starting point the idea that in contemporary societies the loss of our relationship with place is a symptom of a breakdown in the relationship between ethics and aesthetics. This in turn has caused a crisis not only in taste, but also in our sense of beauty, our aesthetic instinct, and our moral values. It has also led to the loss of our engagement with the landscape, which is essential for cities to function.</P> <P>The authors argue that new, fertile forms of interaction between people and space are now happening in what they call the ‘intermediate space’, at the border of “urban normality” and those parts of a city where citizens experiment with unconventional social practices. This new interaction engenders a collective conscience, giving a new and productive vigor to the actions of individuals and also their relations with their environment.</P> <P>These new relations emerge only after we abandon what is called the “therapeutic illusion of space”, which still exists today, and which binds in a deterministic manner the quality of civitas, the associative life of people in the city, to the quality of urban space. Projects for the city should, instead, have as their keystone the notion of social action as a return to a critical perspective, to a courageous acceptance of social responsibility, at the same time as seeking the generative structures of urban life in which civitas and urbs again acknowledge each other.</P>;<P>Analyzes new modes of interaction between city dwellers and the urban environment</P> <P>Explores the concept of the city as an intermediate world between global and local, with fluidity of social aggregation</P> <P>Examines ways of creating shared values and new institutions in cities that are composed of minorities</P> <P>Sees the city as the arena of a new form of social cohesion that will create the urban space of the future</P>;9<HTMELC=ajihij>;Science

How do tree crowns, trees or entire forest stands respond to thinning in the long term? What effect do tree species mixtures and multi-layering have on the productivity and stability of trees, stands or forest enterprises? How do tree and stand growth respond to stress factors such as climate change or air pollution? Furthermore, in the event that one has acquired knowledge about the effects of thinning, mixture and stress, how can one make that knowledge applicable to decision-making in forestry practice? The experimental designs, analytical methods, general relationships and models for answering questions of this kind are the focus of this book. Given the structures dealt with, which range from plant organs to the tree, stand and enterprise levels, and the processes analysed in a time frame of days or months to decades or even centuries, this book is directed at all readers interested in trees, forest stands and forest ecosystems.

Distributional patterns in space and time are described, followed by analyses of the intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics producing these patterns. A strong emphasis is placed on the ongoing changes occurring in the structure and diversity of these communities in response to spiralling environmental impacts, and on state-of-the-art countermeasures aiming to preserve these ecological treasures.

Grid application programmers have to take into account several complicated aspects: distribution of data and computations, parallel computations on different sites and processors, heterogeneity of the involved computers, load balancing, etc. Grid programmers thus demand novel programming methodologies that abstract over such technical details while preserving the beneficial features of modern grid middleware.</P> <P>For this purpose, the authors introduce Higher-Order Components (HOCs). HOCs implement generic parallel/distributed processing patterns, together with the required middleware support, and they are offered to users via a high-level service interface. Users only have to provide the application-specific pieces of their programs as parameters, while low-level implementation details, such as the transfer of data across the grid, are handled by the HOCs. HOCs were developed within the CoreGRID European Network of Excellence and have become an optional extension of the popular Globus middleware. The book provides the reader with hands-on experience, describing a broad collection of example applications from various fields of science and engineering, including biology, physics, etc. The Java code for these examples is provided online, complementing the book. The expected application performance is studied and reported for extensive performance experiments on different testbeds, including grids with worldwide distribution.</P> <P>The book is targeted at graduate students, advanced professionals, and researchers in both academia and industry. Readers can raise their level of knowledge about methodologies for programming contemporary parallel and distributed systems, and, furthermore, they can gain practical experience in using distributed software. Practical examples show how the complementary online material can easily be adopted in various new projects.<BR></P>;;9<HTOGPC=aaieaf>;Science

The presence of giant carbonate mounds in the Porcupine Seabight, on the Porcupine Bank, in the Rockall Trough and on the Rockall Bank, west of Ireland, have been known since the nineties and have been the target of several cruises during the last decade. However, the processes of mound build-up and mound nucleation are not yet completely understood. What keeps a mound growing over extended time periods? How does the biosphere interact with sedimentary fluxes to make a mound grow? On which level do palaeoclimatological and palaeoceanographic changes control mound growth? Which diagenetic processes play an important role in carbonate mound generation and how do they affect the mound?</P> <P>The present study focuses on the nature and significance of the carbonate mound record, and the nature and internal structure of one specific carbonate mound, the Challenger Mound, is described in detail and compared with other mounds from the Irish margin and also with those from the Moroccan margin. The variety of mound characteristics are discussed, along with the associated oceanographic and geological settings and an appropriate classification for recent carbonate mound systems and cold-water coral reefs is presented.

Many currently existing cancer disparities are preventable. To date, few publications capture the breadth and depth of the dimensions of cancer disparities from both the clinical and public health perspective. In this volume, we will broaden concepts of disparities beyond traditional race/ethnicity discussions to explore a more systematic analysis of how, where, and why disparities occur across the cancer continuum.We will also analyze the issue of social disparities with respect to certain major cancers, with emphasis on the particular role of socioeconomic position.

In this volume - using mathematical modeling - processes are described from the biophysics of the interaction of light with pigment systems to the mutual interaction of individual plants and other organisms in canopies and large ecosystems, up to the global ecosystem issues. Chapters are written by 44 international authorities from 15 countries. Mathematics is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis. Properly programmed, contemporary computers are able to mimic complicated processes in living cells, leaves, canopies and ecosystems. These simulations - mathematical models - help us predict the photosynthetic responses of modeled systems under various combinations of environmental conditions, potentially occurring in nature, e.g., the responses of plant canopies to globally increasing temperature and atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration. Tremendous analytical power is needed to understand nature's infinite complexity at every level. </P>;<P>Unique book in its integrated approach to the understanding of photosynthesis processes</P> <P>Presents understanding of photosynthesis by way of mathematical constructions, reflecting essential features of a natural system</P> <P>Chapters are presented with emphasis on the latest break throughs</P> <P>Expected to be a beginning for creating a comprehensive modeling space of photosynthetic processes that would facilitate an ongoing ‘falsification-upgrade’ modeling spiral and would allow mergers between related model lines</P>;9<HTMELC=ajcdgh>;Science

Concluding Reflections.</P>;<P>In recent years there has been a great deal of talk about a possible death of art. As the title of Heidegger’s “The Origin of the Work of Art” suggests, the essay challenges such talk, just as it in turn is challenged by such talk, talk that is supported by the current state of the art-world. It was Hegel, who most profoundly argued that the shape of our modern world no longer permits us to grant art the significance it once possessed. Hegel’s proclamation of the end of art in its highest sense shadows this commentary, as it shadows Heidegger’s essay. Heidegger’s problematic turn from the philosopher Hegel to the poet Hölderlin is born of the conviction that we must not allow Hegel to here have the last word. At stake is the future of art. But more importantly, if we are to accept Heidegger’s argument, at stake is the future of humanity. But all who are eager to find in Heidegger’s essay pointers concerning where not just art, but we should be heading, should be made wary by Heidegger’s politicizing of art and aestheticizing of politics. Both remain temptations that demand a critical response. This commentary demonstrates the continued relevance of Heidegger’s reflections.</P>;<P>The first critical commentary on this important essay</P> <P>Anyone interested in the currently much discussed end of art should read this book</P> <P>Does art still matter?

It is now well understood that the incidence and prevalence of potentially pathogenic mycobacteria is increasing in humans and animals. Further, proof that mycobacteria are normal inhabitants of drinking water distribution systems and household water systems, indicates that humans and animals are surrounded by mycobacteria and thus at risk. It is anticipated that the emphasis on ecology and routes of infection will result in a text of widespread use for clinicians and for research scientists in medicine, academia, and industry. In addition to identifying habitats and thereby sources of mycobacteria infecting humans and animals, the text identifies those mycobacterial characteristics that determine its range of habitats. Additionally, the text comments critically on the available methods to identify those protocols with values in mycobacterial research. In that manner, although there are no chapters specifically devoted to methods, superior methods for mycobacteria will be identified.</P>;<P>All current information on the Ecology of Mycobacteria in one volume</P> <P>Presentation of exhaustive discussion of routes of infection, thus providing guidance to prevention of infection</P> <P>The physiology and genetics relating to the ecology of mycobacteria thus allowing the prediction of the presence of mycobacteria in novel habitats, particularly human engineered habitats</P>;9<HTMELC=ajebcf>;Science

The significance and timeliness of this volume consist in its reflection of several developments in literature and the challenges cities are facing. First, the unsustainability of many of our current paradigms of development has become evidently clear. We are entering an era in which communities across the globe are strengthening their connections to the global flows of capital, goods, ideas, technologies and values while facing at the same time serious dislocations in their traditional socioeconomic structures. While the impending scenarios of climate change impacts remind us about the integrated ecological system that we are part of, the current discussions about global recession in the media alert us and make us aware of the occasional perils of the globalized economic system. The globally dispersed, intricately integrated and hyper-complex socioeconomic-ecological system is difficult to analyze, comprehend and communicate without effective visualization tools. Given that planners are at the frontlines in the effort to prepare as well as build resilience in the impacted communities, appropriate visualization tools are indispensable for effective planning. Second, planners have largely been slow to incorporate the advances in visualization research emerging from other domains of inquiry. </P>;<P>State of the art in visualization of urban and regional planning</P> <P>Reflects the work of an interdisciplinary team</P> <P>Brings together a rich compendium of visualization tools</P>;9<HTOFPA=iicacc>;Professional

It presents a continuation of Dr. Takhtajan’s earlier publications including “Systema Magnoliophytorum” (1987), (in Russian), and “Diversity and Classification of Flowering Plants” (1997), (in English). In his latest book, the author presents a concise and significantly revised system of plant classification (‘Takhtajan system’) based on the most recent studies in plant morphology, embryology, phytochemistry, cytology, molecular biology and palynology. Flowering plants are divided into two classes: class Magnoliopsida (or Dicotyledons) includes 8 subclasses, 126 orders, c. 440 families, almost 10,500 genera, and no less than 195,000 species; and class Liliopsida (or Monocotyledons) includes 4 subclasses, 31 orders, 120 families, more than 3,000 genera, and about 65,000 species.This book contains a detailed description of plant orders, and descriptive keys to plant families providing characteristic features of the families and their differences.</P>";<P>The author is one of the greatest botanists of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century</P> <P>The book presents his most recent last views and understanding of plant evolution</P> <P>The author has a very wide following</P> <P>Young scientists/students will appreciate the opportunity to learn author’s views</P> <P>Young scientists/students will see how Takhtajan’s system is used by other botanists</P> <P>The book is certain to become a classic reference for a wide range of biologists, as well as phylogenists, taxonomists and paleobotanists</P>;9<HTMELC=ajgaic>;Science

Beginning in the 1970s, with nucleic acid enzymology and the discovery of the restriction enzymes, the tools of molecular biology became widely available and applied in cell biology to study how genes are regulated. This new knowledge impacted endocrinology and reproductive biology since it was largely known that the secretion of the internal glands affected the phenotypes, and expression of genes. Modern reproductive biology encompasses every level of biological study from genomics to ecology, encompassing cell biology, biochemistry, endocrinology and general physiology. All of these disciplines require a basic knowledge, both as a tool and as an essential aid to a fundamental understanding of the principles of life in health and disease. Overall, molecular biology is central to scientific studies in all living matter, impacting disciplines such as medicine, related health sciences, veterinary, agriculture and environmental sciences. In this book, the basic biochemistry of nucleic acids and proteins are reviewed. Methodologies used to study signaling and gene regulation in the endocrine/reproductive system are also discussed. Topics include mechanisms of hormone action and several endocrine disorders affecting the reproductive system. Professionals in the medical, veterinary and animal sciences fields will find exciting and stimulating material enhancing the breadth and quality of their research.</P>;;9<HTLDTH=iibifa>;Professional

Since Darwin and Fox were undergraduates together at Christ’s College, Cambridge, and corresponded with each other for the rest of their lives, dying within two years of each other, the diaries allow us a vivid insight into the unique relationship of these two naturalists and family friends. Both were studying to be clergymen of the Church of England, when Darwin was offered a place on The Beagle. Thereafter their lives diverged, as Fox became the country parson that Darwin might have been. Never the less, Fox supplied many facts to Darwin, which were used in the 'Origin of Species' and later books. </P>;<P>New material on the life of Charles Darwin</P> <P>A fresh look at one of the most important biographical sources for the life of Charles Darwin</P> <P>A fascinating account of the lives of two Victorian naturalists</P> <P>A biographical account of the life of Charles Darwin contrasted with his clergyman cousin, William Darwin Fox</P> <P>A new look at the man who introduced Charles Darwin to beetles, William Darwin Fox</P>;9<HTMELC=ajcdcj>;Science

One of the author's goals is not only to describe how the topic develops but also why a specific way is chosen. The explanations do not restrict themselves to mathematical formulas. Only the illustrative explanation relying on the reader's imagination creates comprehension. This book represents the foundations of what nowadays seems necessary to make our environment quieter - in buildings as well as in the open air. Fundamental chapters on the physics and perception of sound precede those on noise reduction methods. A chapter dealing with microphines, loudspeakers, and acoustical antennae is included as well as a chapter on the fundamentals of signal and system theory. Practice exercises with solutions serve for the application of the entire content.;<P>Advanced textbook for mechanical, civil and electrical engineering students</P> <P>New in second edition: chapters on active sound and vibration control as well as fundamentals of signal and system theory</P> <P>Now 101 practice exercises with solutions included</P>;9<HTOFPA=jchcci>;Students

Almost like Bachelier’s now famous dissertation (1900), the work seems to have been forgotten shortly after it was published. However, almost every element of modern option pricing can be found in Bronzin’s book. He derives option prices for an illustrative set of distributions, including the Normal. - This volume includes a reprint of the original German text, a translation, as well as an appreciation of Bronzin's work from various perspectives (economics, history of finance, sociology, economic history) including some details about the professional life and circumstances of the author. The book brings Bronzin's early work to light again and adds an almost forgotten piece of research to the theory of option pricing.</P>;;9<HTOFPA=ifhbaf>;Science

Specifically, the population of neurons which respond to damaging stimuli terminate in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. Therefore, the dorsal horns constitute the first relay site for nociceptive fibre terminals which make synaptic contacts with second order neurons. It has recently become clear that the strength of this first pain synapse is plastic and modifiable by several modulators, including neuronal and non-neuronal regulators, and studies on the fundamental processes regulating the plasticity of the first pain synapse have resulted in the identification of new targets for the treatment of chronic pain.

Its essential nature is to be a set of demonstrated results that increase over time, each logically based on a specific set of axioms or assumptions, yet at every moment, rather than a finished work, these inevitably form an incomplete body of knowledge. The practice of econometric theory consists of selecting from, applying, and evaluating this literature, so as to test its applicability and range. The creation, development, and use of computer software has led applied economic research into a new age. This book describes the history of econometric computation from 1950 to the present day, based upon an interactive survey involving the collaboration of the many econometricians who have designed and developed this software. It identifies each of the econometric software packages that are made available to and used by economists and econometricians worldwide.</P>;<P>Offers a complete overview over all econometric software packages available worldwide</P> <P>Based on an interactive survey of the econometricians who have developed the software</P> <P>Presents the history of the development of econometric computation since the 1950s</P> <P>Gives practical advice as to how to use econometric software in applied economic research</P>;9<HTOFPA=hffhai>;Science

Index.</P>;<P>For decades, casino gaming has been steadily increasing in popularity worldwide. Blackjack is among the most popular of the casino table games, one where astute choices of playing strategy can create an advantage for the player. Risk and Reward analyzes the game in depth, pinpointing not just its optimal strategies but also its financial performance, in terms of both expected cash flow and associated risk.</P> <P>The book begins by describing the strategies and their performance in a clear, straightforward style. The presentation is self-contained, nonmathematical, and accessible to readers at all levels of playing skill, from the novice to the blackjack expert. Careful attention is also given to simplified, but still nearly optimal strategies that are easier to use in a casino. Unlike other books in the literature the author then derives each aspect of the strategy mathematically, to justify its claim to optimality. The derivations mostly use algebra and calculus, although some require more advanced analysis detailed in supporting appendices. For easy comprehension, formulae are translated into tables and graphs through extensive computation.</P> <P>This book will appeal to everyone interested in blackjack: those with mathematical training intrigued by its application to this popular game as well as all players seeking to improve their performance.</P> <P>N. Richard Werthamer is retired from a successful career as a scientist and executive, most recently as the Executive Officer of the American Physical Society.

Viral infections are still difficult to threat and some remained life-threatening diseases in spite of antiviral drug research over decades. Proteases are still regarded as an Achilles’ heel of the pathogens and, thus, protease inhibitors may help to handle the known and the emerging viral threads. The book discusses viral proteases of the most important pathogenic viruses, responsible for severe diseases: AIDS, SARS, Hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus, T-cell lymphotropic virus, Picornavirus. This book focuses specifically on the viral proteases, crucial prerequisites for viral entry into cells and viral replication. Viral proteases represent an important pharmaceutical target. The current stage of protease inhibitor development and therapy are summarised and discussed by experts in the field. This volume represents a timely and valuable continuation of the Proteases in Biology and Disease series. The reader will learn the potential for proteases as targets for effective anti-virals.

These are multiplication, variation and heredity. Only if these factors interact synergistically can Darwinian selection power the evolution of biodiversity. Transposable elements have always played a major role in this process. The genomes of all organisms consist of chromosomes that are built up of double-stranded nucleic acid chains on whose stability and integrity the existence of cells depend. While DNA repair warrants the chemical integrity of DNA and protects it from metabolic and environmental mutagens, meiotic recombination and transposable element activity appear to counteract the molecular guardians of genome stability. Transposable elements and their kind often make up the bulk of genomic DNA, often approaching 50% of the genome. By contrast, the classic genes represent as little as 1.8% of genomic DNA, in case of the human genome. </P> <P></P> <P>This volume gives an overview on mobile DNA and how such contradiction to the obligatory stability of genomes can be understood. Obviously, an understanding can only be achieved by cutting deeply into the evolutionary history of life along with the evolution of transposable elements and dynamic genomes. </P> <P></P> <P>This book therefore also celebrates Charles Darwin’s 200<SUP>th</SUP> birthday. The reader is challenged to view the role of movable DNA along historical roots from the levels of cells to populations to biological species integrating the accompanying molecular evolution of host, cell and genome interaction. One will witness even the reactivation of a long since dead, fossil transposable element and the infection of germline cells by the first established, mobile and endogenous insect retrovirus.</P>;;9<HTOGPC=acaaej>;Science

While we often look at formal compliance procedures, incentive systems and other ‘technical’ ways to ensure effective internal control, this study emphasizes a different perspective: How do the management principles and practices influence organizational culture in order to enhance control effectiveness? New theory is provided on the way that tone at the top – leadership, sustainability, accountability, and other social control aspects – is combined with formal control. The research is based on in-depth interviews with senior-level people (e.g. executives, managers, auditors) from more than 18 renowned U.S. and Swiss companies, and theory from fields of sociology and social psychology. In contrast to contemporary accounting and control research, where culture provides a context for control, here any control mechanism can in turn influence culture.

Phenomena of nature, society, and the human psyche are context bound, constantly changing, and variable. This feature of reality is often not recognized in the social sciences where we operate with averaged data and with homogeneous stereotypes, and consider our consistency to be the cornerstone of rational being. Yet we are all inconsistent in our actions within a day, or from, one day to the next, and much of such inconsistency is of positive value for our survival and development. Our inconsistent behaviors and thoughts may appear chaotic, yet there is generality within this highly variable dynamic.</P> <P>The task of scientific methodologies—qualitative and quantitative—is to find out what that generality is. It is the aim of this handbook to bring into one framework various directions of construction of methodology of the dynamic processes that exist in the social sciences at the beginning of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. This handbook is set up to bring together pertinent methodological scholarship from all over the world, and equally from the quantitative and qualitative orientations to methodology. In addition to consolidating the pertinent knowledge base for the purposes of its further growth, this book serves the major educational role of bringing practitioners—students, researchers, and professionals interested in applications—the state of the art know-how about how to think about extracting evidence from single cases, and about the formal mathematical-statistical tools to use for these purposes.</P>;<P>Covers the whole realm of the social sciences in which the analysis of dynamics of single systems is relevant – mostly in psychology, but also in sociology, anthropology, and education</P> <P>Provides new methodology for the study of psychological and educational processes based on individual performance profiles</P>;9<HTLDTH=jfjcbe>;Science

How should the police change to counter terrorism threats? What implications do such changes have for traditional responsibilities of the police like combating crime, or in the resources or focus of modern police agencies? <EM>To Protect and To Serve:</EM> <EM>Policing in an Age of Terrorism </EM>brings together distinguished American and Israeli policing scholars, who pool their knowledge and experience to shed light on what has happened to policing since the turn of the century, and what trends can be expect over the next few decades. </P> <P><EM>To Protect and To Serve</EM> begins by asking what terrorism is and what forms it takes, and discusses how it raises new questions for democratic societies and democratic policing. While many scholars and lay people take for granted the fact that the police should play a central role in the fight against terrorism, the volume also examines critically the rationale for the police role. Accordingly a chapter also examines the role that the police should play in the complex task of preventing, and responding to terror, and responding to the outcomes of terror? Another chapter begins with a description of the specific strategies and tactics that police agencies have developed to deal with terrorism (and the outcomes of terrorism), and assesses what works both in preventing terrorism and in dealing with its consequences. A critical issue that has received comparatively little attention is addressed in another chapter, which examines how police agencies responded organizationally to the added responsibilities of fighting terrorism. Finally, the book also examines the impact of fighting terrorism on minority and majority communities, and the questions of legitimacy that are raised by new roles that police take on. </P>;<P>It provides the first comprehensive assessment of the role of the police in homeland security functions, the effectiveness of strategies, the impacts of homeland security threats on police organization, and on the relationships between police and community</P> <P>The authors include some of the best known scholars in policing and in the area of policing terrorism brought together by the National Institute of Justice and the Ministry of Public Security in Israel to provide cutting edge discussion of the challenges presented by terrorism for police in democratic societies</P> <P>Each chapter includes not only an up to date survey of the literature in the areas covered, but also a discussion what we need to know to develop better policies and practices</P>;9<HTLDTH=hdgieg>;Science

For this volume, King and Baeza-Yates selected some pioneering and cutting-edge research work that is pointing to the future of the Web. Based on the Workshop Track of the 17th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2008) in Beijing, they selected the top contributions and asked the authors to resubmit their work with a minimum of one third of additional material from their original workshop manuscripts to be considered for this volume. After a second-round of reviews and selection, 16 contributions were finally accepted. The work within this volume represents the tip of an iceberg of the many exciting advancements on the WWW. It covers topics like semantic web services, location-based and mobile applications, personalized and context-dependent user interfaces, social networks, and folksonomies. The presentations aim at researchers in academia and industry by showcasing latest research findings. Overall they deliver an excellent picture of the current state-of-the-art, and will also serve as the basis for ongoing research discussions and point to new directions.</P>;;9<HTOGPC=aafgjf>;Science

He is universally admired as a long-standing pillar of the discipline of computer science. He has contributed to the development of fundamental research in artificial intelligence in the area of complexity and spatial-temporal reasoning as well as in the area of compiler optimization. Golumbic's work in graph theory led to the study of new perfect graph families such as tolerance graphs, which generalize the classical graph notions of interval graph and comparability graph. He is credited with introducing the systematic study of algorithmic aspects in intersection graph theory, and initiated research on new structured families of graphs including the edge intersection graphs of paths in trees (EPT) and trivially perfect graphs.</P> <P>Golumbic is currently the founder and director of the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Institute for Interdisciplinary Applications of Computer Science at the University of Haifa. He also served as chairman of the Israeli Association of Artificial Intelligence (1998-2004), and founded and chaired numerous international symposia in discrete mathematics and in the foundations of artificial intelligence.</P> <P>This Festschrift volume, published in honor of Martin Charles Golumbic on the occasion of his 60th birthday, contains 20 papers, written by graduate students, research collaborators, and computer science colleagues, who gathered at a conference on subjects related to Martin Golumbic's manifold contributions in the field of algorithmic graph theory and artificial intelligence, held in Jerusalem, Tiberias and Haifa, Israel in September 2008.</P>;;9<HTOGPC=acacif>;Science

This study uses a cross-country approach to look at a broad range of issues related to consumer credit in Europe. Focusing on both the supply and demand sides, it takes into account the structure and performance of financial intermediaries, the socio-demographic and economic profile of households and their risk of over-indebtedness, as well as the regulatory framework, such as the new Consumer Credit Directive. In the light of this analysis, measures for the prevention and management of over-indebtedness are presented. This book is essential for postgraduate students and specialists in financial institutions, for regulators and policy-makers who are in charge of efficiency and stability of financial systems.</P>;;9<HTOHUA=icbaaa>;Science

By virtue of combining the actuation and sensing capabilities of piezoelectric materials with the advantages of fiber composites, the anisotropic constitutive properties may be tailored according to requirements and the failure behavior can be improved. Such adaptive fiber composites are very well-suited for the task of noise and vibration reduction. In this respect the helicopter rotor system represents a very interesting and widely perceptible field of application. The occurring oscillations can be reduced with aid of aerodynamic couplings via fast manipulation of the angle of attack, being induced by twist actuation of the rotor blade. On the one hand the sensing properties may be used to determine the current state of deformation, while on the other hand the actuation properties may be used to attain the required state of deformation. The implementation of such concepts requires comprehensive knowledge of the theoretical context, which shall be illuminated in the work at hand from the examination of the material behavior to the simulation of the rotating structure. </P>;<UL> <LI>Thorough, systematic treatment of theory with several innovations and improvements</LI> <P> <LI>Detailed examination and extension of applicable variational principles</LI> <P></P> <P> <LI>Complete modeling from the continuum via fiber composite, laminated shell, and thin-walled beam to the rotating structure</LI> <P></P> <P> <LI>Consistent derivation of analytic as well as numeric solutions for the static respectively dynamic behavior of the non-rotating and rotating structure</LI> <P></P></UL>;9<HTUAPI=bceded>;Science

The theoretical basis for their development is derived from the application of convex optimization tools to problems involving positivity of homogeneous polynomial forms. Usually, stability and performance analysis of dynamic systems affected by structured uncertainties, requires the solution of non-convex optimization problems. Constructing a family of convex relaxations, namely convex optimisations, can provide upper or lower bound to the original problem. In this book convex relaxations for several robustness problems are derived by exploiting and providing new results on the theory of homogeneous polynomial forms. A framework is introduced for dealing with positivity of homogeneous forms via the solution of linear matrix inequalities, with examples including Lyapunov analysis of uncertain systems, computation of the parametric robust stability margin, and robust performance analysis for polytopic systems.</P>;<P>Allows the reader to increase the robustness of control systems subject to uncertainties thanks to striking advances in convex optimization</P> <P>Draws together a number of well-established tools in control and system theory so that the reader can see how they interact and make use of all of them in an appropriate balance</P>;9<HTMIPI=ichiag>;Science

Jahrhunderts wurde zum Titel dieser legendären Einstein-Biographie von Abraham Pais. Bereits 1982 erschienen, hat diese wissenschaftshistorisch und ideengeschichtlich ausgelegte Biographie nichts an ihrer Aussagekraft verloren, da neue Forschungsergebnisse eher die Privatsphäre und die Presseveröffentlichungen unter neuem Licht zeigen - Aspekte, die Pais in seiner zweiten Einsteinbiographie 'Ich vertraue auf Intuition' auf ebenfalls einzigartige Art dargestellt hat. Pais, der in Princeton den Beinamen 'Mister Quantenfeldtheorie' hatte und mit Einstein als junger Kollege ins Gespräch kam, schreibt in der Einführung zu seiner Biographie: 'Meine Diskussionen mit Einstein waren niemals historische Interviews. Sie betrafen die lebendige Physik, und ich bin froh, daß es nicht anders war.' Insofern vereinigt diese Biographie zwei Bücher in einem: ein Buch über Einsteins Leben, und ein zweites über sein Physikverständnis. Dabei schildert Pais das Leben Einsteins spannend und unterhaltsam - Einstein war berühmt für seine lockeren Sprüche. Und er führt zugleich fundierte physikalische Argumente an, um zu zeigen, daß einige Vorurteile über Einsteins Sicht der Quantentheorie falsch sind - so hat Einstein nach eigenen Angaben mehr über die Quantentheorie nachgedacht als über die Relativitätstheorie, und seine Vision einer einheitlichen Feldtheorie prägt immer noch die modernen Ansätze einer vereinheitlichten Theorie für Alles.;;9<HTOINH=ecedhc>;Sachbuch

Academic, government, and corporate laboratories have devoted years of effort to the development of strategies to prevent or treat viral infections. Central to the multiplication strategy of all viruses is the process of genome replication. Enzymes critical to this step of the lifecycle have proven to be tractable targets for the development of antiviral agents. Furthermore, genome replication is essential for virus spread and is the main target for the development of antiviral agents. By combining studies of both RNA and DNA viruses - and more - into a single volume, the editors have created a mechanism for cross-talk between the fields that will produce synergy and could lead to more rapid discovery of approaches to treat viral infections.</P>;Provides the first comprehensive review of viral genome replication strategies, emphasizing not only pathways and regulation but also the structure-function, mechanism, and inhibition of proteins and enzymes required for this process;9<HTLDTH=ijecfg>;Science

Since the NQR frequency is insensitive to long-range variations in composition, mixing explosives with other materials, such as the plasticizers in plastic explosives, makes no difference. The NQR signal strength varies linearly with the amount of explosive, and is independent of its distribution within the volume monitored. NQR spots explosive types in configurations missed by the X-ray imaging method.</P> <P>But if NQR is so good, why it is not used everywhere ? Its main limitation is the low signal-to-noise ratio, particularly with the radio-frequency interference that exists in a field environment, NQR polarization being much weaker than that from an external magnetic field. The distinctive signatures are there, but are difficult to extract from the noise. In addition, the high selectivity is partly a disadvantage, as it is hard to build a multichannel system necessary to cover a wide range of target substances. Moreover, substances fully screened by metallic enclosures, etc. are difficult to detect. A workshop was held at St Petersburg in July 2008 in an attempt to solve these problems and make NQR the universal technique for the detection of bombs regardless of type.

The modeling is based on an extensive application of the method of discrete vortices in aircraft flights at high altitudes and on a conjugation of this method with the integral method of predicting the turbulent boundary layer which is produced at the secondary wall transversal flow induced by the aircraft vertex system at take-of-landing regimes. In this latter case an interaction between the vortex wake of aircraft and the secondary vortices generated at boundary layer separations is taken into account.</P> <P>The authors consider separately methods of modeling the near and far vortex wakes of aircrafts with turbojets and air propellers and they present the results of predicting vortex wakes of a series of domestic and foreign aircrafts.

But both sides actually agree more than they disagree, and what has long been needed is a third way to view evolution, one that focuses more on the aspect of life and “being alive”, one that can guide us through, and perhaps out of, the fiery thicket. This book, a seminal work in the burgeoning field of Biosemiotics, provides that third way, by viewing living beings as genuine agents designing their communication pathways with, and in, the world.</P> <P>Already hailed as the best account of biological hermeneutics, <EM>Life As Its Own Designer: Darwin’s</EM> Origin <EM>and Western Thought</EM> is a wholly unique book divided into two parts. The first part is philosophical and explores the roots of rationality and the hermeneutics of the natural world with the overriding goal of discovering how narrative can help us to explain life. It analyzes why novelty is so hard to comprehend in the framework of Western thinking and confronts head-on the chasm between evolutionism and traditional rationalistic worldviews. The second part is scientific. It focuses on the life of living beings, treating them as co-creators of their world in the process of evolution. It draws on insights gleaned from the global activity of the Gaian biosphere, considers likeness as demonstrated on homology studies, and probes the problem of evo-devo science from the angle of life itself.</P> <P>This book is both timely and vital. Past attempts at a third way to view evolution have failed because they were written either by scientists who lacked a philosophical grounding or New Age thinkers who lacked biological credibility. Markoš and his coworkers form an original group of thinkers supremely capable in both fields, and they have fashioned a book that is ideal for researchers and scholars from both the humanities and sciences who are interested in the history and philosophy of biology, biosemiotics, and the evolution of life.</P>;<P>Philosophical foundation to the fields of evolution and development</P> <P>Synthesis of interdisciplinary content</P> <P>Anticipates new biological thinking</P> <P>A new angle on the 'evolution vs creation' debate</P>;9<HTMELC=ajjgje>;Science

Location problems establish a set of facilities (resources) to minimize the cost of satisfying a set of demands (customers) with respect to a set of constraints. There are four components that describe location problems: customers, who are assumed to be already located at points or on routes, facilities that will be located, a space in which customers and facilities are located, and a metric that indicates geographical and chronological distances between customers and facilities. This book describes these parts in each specific location model. Location models are used in a variety of applications such as locating warehouses within a supply chain to minimize the average time to market, locating noxious material to maximize its distance to the public, etc. In this book, readers can find these applications exemplified by real-world cases for each particular model. The relationship between location problems and other areas such as supply chains is also considered here. </P>;;9<HTOHUA=icbfaf>;Science

The discovery of dopamine as a neuronal entity in the late 1950’s and the notion that it serves in neurotransmission has been a milestone in the field of neuroscience research. This milestone marked the beginning of an era that explored the brain as an integrated collection of neuronal systems that one could distinguish on basis of neurotransmitter identities, and importantly, in which one started to be able to pinpoint the seat of brain disease.</P> <P>The chapters presented in this book provide an overview of the different stages that are distinguished during mdDA neuronal development. Chapter 1 discusses the dopamine systems of the zebrafish, being a powerful model organism for genetic intervention on the developmental programming of neuronal systems. In Chapter 2 an overview is presented of dopamine systems that are present in the vertebrate CNS. Chapters 3-6 discuss the early specification of dopamine precursors and the programs that lead to terminal differentiation. In Chapters 7 and 8 the maintenance of dopamine neurons is discussed with a special emphasis on neurotrophic support. The specific connectivity of the dopamine system and the axon guidance rules that apply to developing dopamine neurons are described in Chapter 9. An overview of ES-cell engineering of dopamine neurons is presented in Chapters 10 and 11.</P> <P>The research directed towards unraveling the molecular programming of mdDA neurons continues to be highly exciting. One may expect that novel biological principles will continue to emerge from this population of neurons. In the near future the field as a whole will mature towards a more comprehensive understanding of mdDA neuronal development and network integration, and will continue to apply knowledge of dopamine neuron development and function to the treatment of human disease.</P>;;9<HTMEPB=jadcbb>;Science

The behavior of fluids at these scales is quite different from that at the macroscopic level due to the presence of surface tension effects, wetting phenomena, Brownian diffusion and hydrodynamic interactions with immersed particles and microstructures. These effects cannot be generally represented in a classical homogeneous continuum framework. However, this triggers the development of new tools to investigate and simulate problems at the meso-scopic level.</P> <P>This book contains a collection of works presented at the IUTAM Symposium on Advances on Micro and Nano-fluidics held in Dresden in 2007. It covers several subjects of wide interest for micro and nano-fluidics applications focusing on both, analytical and numerical approaches. Topics covered in particular include multi-scale particle methods for numerical simulations, liquid-wall interactions and modeling approaches, modeling of immersed nano-scale structures, organized flow behavior at micro and nano-scales, and methods for control of micro- and nano-scale flows.</P>;Papers reflect the state of the art in the field of micro- and nanofluidics;9<HTUAPI=bcgcff>;Science

They have selected numerous case studies from actual events that illustrate various typologies of terrorist actions, be it from a separatist, nationalist, lone-wolf individual terrorist, religious fanatics or environmentalist orientation, and they present these cases within the context of following the trajectories of the terrorist activity, the terrorist act itself and, the response to the event from the relevant authorities.</P> <P>Some chapters concentrate on terrorist attacks that actually took place, others speculate about the possibilities of an attack occurring sometime in the future, such as the chapters on the Olympic Games, Aviation or Rail Security.

The text deals with the well-known Lorenz, Rössler and Hénon attractors and the Chua circuit and with less celebrated novel systems. Modelling of chaos is accomplished using difference equations and ordinary and time-delayed differential equations. The methods directed at controlling chaos benefit from the influence of advanced nonlinear control theory: inverse optimal control is used for stabilization; exact linearization for synchronization; and impulsive control for chaotification. Notably, a fusion of chaos and fuzzy systems theories is employed. Time-delayed systems are also studied.

But logically extending this wisdom implies that associated principals – voters, consumers, shareholders – will favor themselves over the greater good when ‘rules of the game’ instead create too much accountability. Democratic Governance and Economic Performance rigorously develops this hypothesis, and finds statistical evidence and case study illustrations that democratic institutions at various governance levels (e.g., federal, state, corporation) have facilitated opportunistic gains for electoral, consumer, and shareholder principals. To be sure, this conclusion does not dismiss the potential for democratic governance to productively reduce agency costs. Rather, it suggests that policy makers, lawyers, and managers can improve governance by weighing the agency benefits of increased accountability against the distributional costs of favoring principal stakeholders over more general economic opportunities. Carefully considering the fundamentals that give rise to this tradeoff should interest students and scholars working at the intersection of social science and the law, and can help professionals improve their own performance in policy, legal, and business settings.</P>;<P>Challenges conventional wisdom about the benefits of democratic governance in organizations</P> <P>Provides evidence how “democracy can go too far” and thus decrease economic performance</P> <P>Applies theory to macro-governance level (monetary, fiscal, and trade policy), intermediate-level of governance (antitrust laws and competition policies) and the micro-level (corporate governance)</P>;9<HTLDTH=hihaga>;Science

Administrative Discourse and State Lotteries.- Conclusion.</P>;"<P>George Bush’s 1988 campaign pledge, “Read my lips: no new taxes”, has become a mantra for those who distrust politicians and bureaucrats. The gulf between what political leaders say and do seems to be widening, and in democratic societies around the world, contributing to an atmosphere of cynicism and apathy among the citizenry. Understanding the characteristics and functions of speech in policy processes is a requirement for trying to overcome this problem; indeed, politicians and bureaucrats spend a good proportion of their time and resources discoursing, i.e., writing, speaking, and publishing. However, there has been scant analysis of political discourse; the aim of this book is to help fill this analytical gap, by exploring political speech from a variety of perspectives, including normative, epistemological, and empirical. Incorporating insights from economics, political science, philosophy, and law, and evidence from the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Turkey, and the EU, the book addresses a wide variety of timely issues, including:</P> <P></P> <UL> <P> <LI>Fiscal discipline in speeches vs budget balance: Is an improvement (deterioration) of the budget balance preceded by a more (less) fiscally disciplined discourse? </LI> <P></P> <P> <LI>Revenues forecasted in budget speeches vs realized budget outcomes: Is there a systematic bias? If so, how can we explain it?</LI> <P></P> <P> <LI>Electoral pledges vs actual realizations: Do governments follow up on their electoral pledges? </LI> <P></P> <P> <LI>Ideological stance in party publications vs spending and revenues of party governments: Do parties of the right and the left speak different languages?

These compounds have important ecological functions, providing protection against attack by herbivores and microbes and serving as attractants for pollinators and seed-dispersing agents. They may also contribute to competition and invasiveness by suppressing the growth of neighboring plant species (a phenomenon known as allelopathy). Humans exploit natural products as sources of drugs, flavoring agents, fragrances and for a wide range of other applications. Rapid progress has been made in recent years in understanding natural product synthesis, regulation and function and the evolution of metabolic diversity. It is timely to bring this information together with contemporary advances in chemistry, plant biology, ecology, agronomy and human health to provide a comprehensive guide to plant-derived natural products. </P> <P><EM>Plant-derived natural products: synthesis, function and application</EM> provides an informative and accessible overview of the different facets of the field, ranging from an introduction to the different classes of natural products through developments in natural product chemistry and biology to ecological interactions and the significance of plant-derived natural products for humans.

The experimental studies they carried out during more than ten years start from the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation developed at the University of Amsterdam, their home university. In these studies they test methodically the intersubjective acceptability of the rules for critical discussion proposed in this theory by confronting ordinary arguers who have not received any special education in argumentation and fallacies with discussion fragments containing both fallacious and non-fallacious argumentative moves. The research covers a wide range of informal fallacies. In this way, the authors create a basis for comparing the theoretical reasonableness conception of pragma-dialectics with the norms for judging argumentative moves prevailing in argumentative practice. <EM>Fallacies and Judgments of Reasonableness </EM>provides a unique insight into the relationship between theoretical and practical conceptions of reasonableness, supported by extensive empirical material gained by means of sophisticated experimental research.</P>;<P>First systematic experimental research of reasonableness conceptions of ordinary arguers</P> <P>Starting from a clearly defined theoretical basis</P> <P>Reporting about a continued series of experimental tests</P> <P>Up to standard with modern methodology</P> <P>Covering a wide range of well known informal fallacies</P>;9<HTUAPI=bcgbdc>;Science
